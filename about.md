My name is Spencer and I am a Junior Computer Science (Games) student studying at the University of Southern California. I develop games in my free time and will post some of the cool stuff I make on this website.

# Tools I Use
Here's a list of tools that I use during development or project-related stuff.
## Editors
-   [*Visual Studios Code (free)*](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Download")
    -   This is the best *free* lightweight code editor I have used so far. Very customizable and powerful.
-   [*Visual Studios Community (free)*](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ "Download")
    -   This is a good *free* IDE for working on larger projects. It helps you setup a more integrated development environment for things like C#. It also has a lot of built-in tools that can help with debugging.
-   [*Notepad++ (free)*](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ "Download")
    -   Regular Notepad, but with syntax highlighting and other features for programmers.

## Terminals
-   [*Windows Terminal (free)*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701 "Store Page")
    -   Think *Windows Powershell*, but more. Multiple tabs for different terminal shells, themes, other customization options.
-   [*Git (free)*](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Download")
    -   Does a good job of simulating a Linux-based terminal on a windows environment.

## Note-Taking
-   [*Microsoft OneNote*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app "Store Page")
    -   Let's you take notes either through your keyboard or a drawing tablet. Feels like a "real life" notepad (but digital).
-   [*Overleaf (free)*](https://www.overleaf.com/ "Online Editor")
    -   Overleaf's online editor makes doing *LaTeX* write-ups extremely easy. You can also collaborate online, similarly to Google Docs. (I haven't used this feature yet, but I've heard from others who also use it).

## Art
-   [*Aesprite*](https://www.aseprite.org/ "You can get it on Steam as well...")
    -   I like the feel and the environment that this tool gives, but I absolutely hate their "Save As" function (why make your own when you can just use the built-in Windows one?)
-   [*Krita (free)*](https://krita.org/ "Download")
    -   Think *free* Adobe Photoshop for digital painting.

## Other Cool Stuff
-   [*Super Alt-F4 (free)*](https://stefansundin.github.io/superf4/ "Download")
    -   Ever get those awkward moments where some program is frozen and can't be closed. But it's frozen to the point where you can't even alt-tab to task manager and ALT-F4 doesn't work (truly despicable!)? Super Alt-F4 keybinds a *better* version of force quit that can close all programs instantly.
