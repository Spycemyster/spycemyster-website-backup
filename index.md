# Spencer Chang
My name is Spencer and I am a rising senior Computer Science (Games) student studying at the University of Southern California. I develop games in my free time and will post some of the things I make on this website.

Be sure to check out the [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/ "Projects") page (and the other stuff in the top right) for some cool stuff :))
