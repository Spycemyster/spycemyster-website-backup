title: Working On SpyceLibrary
---

I'm currently working on a small library that is built on *Monogame* for making it easier to create 2D games. Here's the link to the Github project page: [Here](https://github.com/Spycemyster/SpyceLibrary "Github Project Page")

I'm also experimenting with various types of content on my website. I've recently added a small "review sheet"-styled page for [*Derivatives*]({{ site.baseurl }}/math/derivatives/ "Derivatives").

I'm currently in the works of moving Vortex Dodger onto this site (Or just completely rework the codebase for that project).
