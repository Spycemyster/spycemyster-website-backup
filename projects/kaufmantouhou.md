Fight your way through Lich Queen NORTA's robot army!

The year is 2150, the Space Kingdom's defenses are held by Princess Satele's magic powers. Lich Queen NORTA, a half-undead machine, has been building a drone army for the past century. She hopes to take over the world and enslave its people. Hoping to advance her invasion, NORTA kidnaps Princess Satele. With the Space Kingdom at risk of enslavement, the King sends Sir Norwood of Titan to rescue Satele.
